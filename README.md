The game is Paper, Scissors, Rock.

To start the game push the button above the matrix.

Each round starts by pushing the navswitch down on both controllers. Once each round starts, each player can scroll through the options of paper, scissors or rock using the navswitch.
When a player chooses their selection for that round, push the navswitch down to send it to the other player. When a player has recieved the other player's selection, the blue LED will turn on until they send their selection. Once a selection is sent, that player is unable to change their selection.

Once both players have chosen their selection for that round, the winner is chosen by the following criteria:
Paper beats rock.
Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beats paper.

After each round, each player's score will be displayed on their own LED matrix until the next round is started. If the game is a draw, neither player's score changes. To dismiss the scoreboard, press the navswitch down.
During each round, the player's own score is displayed in the right hand column of the LED matrix with each LED representing 1 point.

The game ends after one player scores 6 points or after the 9th round.
The LED matrix will then display the result message for each player. These are either "You Win", "You Lose", or "Its a Draw". 

After the game, pushing the button above the LED matrix will reset the game back to the original state when the fun kit is turned on.
